# Password Generator
I was tasked with updating the js file for the web app to generate a password when the button was pressed.  I first asked the user to input the length of the password and verified whether the input was a number within range.  Then I asked the user to select which character types they would like to include, checking to make sure they selected at least one type. I then made an array of the possible characters and appended them to a password bank array based on the options selected.  Finally the password was generated by randomly selecting a character of each type, to ensure each type was used at least once, followed by randomly selecting from the password bank for the remainder of the password length selected.
